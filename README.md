##  What is Deskrambler?

Deskrambler is a lightweight Chrome extension built to *de-distractionify* LinkedIn.  
No more endless feeds. No DMs. No notifications.  
Just you, your job search, and sweet, sweet silence.

If LinkedIn is a noisy coffee shop, Deskrambler gives you noise-canceling headphones.

## 🛠️ How It Works

Deskrambler uses a simple `content.js` script to find and hide distracting LinkedIn elements. It does not track you, collect any data, or phone home. All modifications happen locally in your browser.

## Installation

Until it's on the Chrome Web Store:

1. Clone this repo or download the ZIP  
2. Go to `chrome://extensions` in your browser  
3. Enable **Developer mode** (top-right toggle)  
4. Click **Load unpacked**  
5. Select the folder where you saved Deskrambler  
6. Boom. You're in distraction-free mode.

##  Privacy

Deskrambler collects *zero* user data.  
No tracking. No logging. No weirdness.
